People remain at other places in Rasuwa, such as Dhunche, Syaphru Besi, and Thuman VDC. Most roads in the area are not motorable or passable, but several individuals have reported that the main road south from Dhunche is passable on foot (obstructed by rockfall, but with no new large landslides - amazingly). Evacuation efforts can thus be conducted from the Kalikasthan/Ramche area, above Betrawati via vehicle - the road is reported clear from Betrawati to Kathmandu.

Devastation of local villages and agricultural lands in the district of Rasuwa remain severe. And casualties in the Langtang valley are estimated near 300.

746,Selang 9- Help Wanted,2015-04-30 20:35:00,VDC Selang-9,"Remote VDC Selang-9, Sindhupalchowk. Report from Shashank.

This is from a FB post (sad sad one) of Sashank of a remote village in Sindhupalchowk district of Nepal.

My home is Sindhupalchowk, and I am from remote VDC Selang-9. My home and my village is completely destroyed. I have walked three hours this evening down to nearby Jalbire town. I had come to this nearby town hoping to meet some relief workers, but until now I am yet to meet anyone. I could access Facebook in Jalbire. I could not access the NTC and NCELL network. Sky (network) used to exist, but has ceased to work after earthquake.

Not a bit of chau-chau (ramen noodles) and biscuit has reached my village yet. I learned from Facebook that most think of Sankhu, Melamchi, Chautara and Barabise when they think of Sindhupalchowk. Sindhupalchowk is very remote, with 70-80 village development committees. This earthquake has destroyed the whole of Sindhupalchowk. 99% of it. Among my relatives in my village, 15 have died. This death may not even be counted or acted upon. If the rescue team goes to all villages and counts the death tool, there will most likely be 5-6 thousands in Sindhupalchowk alone. So many more are still unknown. Rescue teams have reached neither in our village, nor other 100-200 villages. We dug out many dead bodies through mutual help. Still many remain. Lots of animals have died, and it is beginning to stink. To reach my home, you have to walk further 25 kilometers from the Arniko highway. I know that there are many other villages that can be reached by over one day’s trek from my village. If nothing has reached my village, you can imagine if anything has reached in other villages.

I do not know why I am posting all this. There is a healthpost near my village. I know that people from villages located one days’ walk from my village come to this health post to get cetamol (popular painkiller in Nepal). I am not expecting that the villages that have not yet seen cetamol during all these years will see rescue teams.

Still I will be grateful if someone reads this post and tells the concerned agencies that Sindhupalchowk is big and remote. I will be truly grateful if someone takes initiative to ensure that supports are not limited to Sankhu and Melamchi, but all 70 VDCs including to our village.

I am writing these notes you requested on behalf of Mr. Lotte Lama - a former resident of Upper Tsum Valley in the village of Chhokang Paro.  He asked me to send you his report.  These notes are in hopes of your facilitation of much needed food to the three areas of Tsum.  Nubri, Lower and Upper Tsum.  Lotte has heard from his sister who is a nun at Rachen Gompa near Burji.  The Gompa is easy to see from the air.  It has a red plaster and stone fence around the property.

1.  Barpak is approximately 30-40 miles from Chhokang Paro in Upper Tsum.  The trail to Tsum goes up the Budhi Gandaki and most likely completely unusable because of landslides. There are no roads into any part of Tsum. Helicopter is only way in now. 

2.  There are approximately 10-11,000 people in all of Tsum Valley.

3.  The people are in desperate need of food.  Rice, wheat, noodles, cooking oil and vegetables are important.

There were water taps in the villages and we don't know if they are still working.  There is a river through the main valley for Upper and Lower Tsum for water supplies.

4. They request warm clothes for babies, kids and adults.  The Upper Tsum sits at about 10,000 ft (over 3,000 meters).  It is very cold there right now.

5.  Chhokang Paro seems to be the hardest hit by the quake.  We know the village of Chhokang Paro is completely leveled. No structures exist now.  Unfortunately the grain and food for humans and livestock in mixed into the mess of rocks, timbers and water - and completely lost.  This is a huge humanitarian crisis as there is no way to resupply these residents by land. 
It is reported there is less structural damage as one goes up the valley toward Mu Gompa.

6.  In Lower Tsum - Ripchet had a substantial fire in the village.  There might be injuries there.  We don't know. We have not heard from Chumling. The trail is blocked. There is no electricity or communication in the valley.

7.  Nubri is to the west of these areas of Tsum and we don't know what has happened there.  Tsum residents have not been able to communicate with them. But it is similar to Lower and Upper Tsum - and very hard to travel there. There is a major monastery at Surang Gompa nearish to Nubri.  We don't know how they fared in the quake.

8.  In Upper Tsum there are plenty of open fields to land an helicopter...near Chhokang Paro.  There are fields to the immediate south of Ripchet in which to land.  There is a new trekkers' lodge at Burji and a field just to the immediate north for landing.  If the copter goes over a Mr. Dhawa Lama will probably come out to direct the copter to a landing spot.  There is a grassy field behind his lodge.  He is there now with some French trekkers.

9.  There is a nun at Domje in Lower Tsum who is trained as a dentist and doctor. She might be a big help if she can be contacted and given medical supplies.","Blocked Roads, Medical Assiatance, Food/Water/Shelter, ",28.505161,85.073058,Region,+1-703-864-3622,Ron,Ranson,rranson@ucsd.edu,YES,NO,,,,,,

If you wish to talk to me, my number is 9818673545, 

In Bungamati there are 1200 families (4000-6000 people)displaced.

NEEDS: sufficient shelter for them to be comfortable whilst they rebuild their homes. At present there are some tents and plastic sheeting, but conditions are cramped. More shelter needed.

TOILETS: Displaced people do not have access to toilets and are defecating in the open, presenting serious health risks. LATRINES ARE A PRIORITY.

WATER: There is water in the communal tanks which is being refilled by tanker, however it is being used faster than it is being replenished.

RUBBLE CLEARING: There is significant damage to many buildings in Bungamati,and people lack tools and equipment to clear the rubble. 

They report they are ok for food and medicine at present, but could do with more clothes (especially children).

They also report that most of contributions have come from individual donations, rather than government or aid support. 

It is thought there is no one trapped in the rubble, but this is unconfirmed.

The assistant at the clinic is Debaki and her phone number is 9808513731 but her battery is very low. Another number is Pradam Bahadur Ghale 9849185980 and another is Ram Bahadur Ghale 9816627276. I know this is a long shot but these people are still alive and need help. Others in surrounding area who know of the clinic will undoubtedly be heading there for medical assistance if they are able.

Although the main building of the clinic was destroyed, we believe that another section, containing medical supplies and some shelter is still intact. More importantly, the clinic is staffed by a physicians assistant and former army medic, who have escaped injury and are helping local residents. There is also an open level area (unusual for this area) that we believe is suitable as a helicopter landing zone.

Approximately 7,000 people, many elderly and children live in the Baseri region and it is the northern most settlement in that section of Nepal, approximately 25 miles from the epicenter. People seeking medical care will likely go to the clinic and we believe it could serve as a valuable staging area for medical assistance.

272,Carnage at Langtang,2015-04-29 10:53:00,"Langtang, Rasuwa, Bagmati, Central Development Region, Nepal","Some information about the effects of the earthquake in the Langtang Valley, as well as the rest of Rasuwa:
 
 The village of Langtang was the site of the largest single catastrophe, as the entirety of village was completely buried by an avalanche that came from thousands of feet above on the southern slopes of Langtang Lirung and Langtang II. Smaller settlements on the outskirts of Langtang, such as Chyamki, Thangsyap, and Mundu were also buried. It is impossible to determine exactly how many people died there, but the estimate is perhaps over 300 people in total. The handful of survivors, roughly twelve locals and two foreigners, walked down to Ghodatabela below after spending the night of the 25th in a cave - thus there is no one at Langtang itself. This avalanche is perhaps 2-3 kilometers wide, and is obstructing movement within the upper valley corridor. Currently two large groups are stranded above and below (due to several intensive and recurring landslides in the steep sections between Ghodatabela and Lama Hotel).
 
 Above, at Kyangjin Gompa, there were reportedly fewer casualties (perhaps 5-10) yet many injured. Most of the injured have been evacuated via helicopter and there is an army medic team in place. Yet, currently, the problem is one of food shortage and illness. I have heard that the majority of the settlement, including the gompa, is remarkably intact. There is a smaller group of about 30-40 at the settlement of Sindum, about 4km below Kyangjin and closer to Langtang. This group has excavated several bodies from the major avalanche zone. They have also evacuated many of the injured, but are facing severe food shortages and illness (hopefully remedied by Nepal Army reinforcements and supplies on the evening of the 27th. Above Kyangjin Gompa, there were several smaller groups and climbing teams exploring the Upper Langtang valley, in a very high avalanche risk zone – I do not have good information on these groups, so please contact the respective embassies to determine who has been accounted for and evacuated via Kyangjim. As of the evening of April 27th, there was perhaps  120-140 people remaining above Langtang who need to be evacuated.
 
 Below, at Ghodatabela (where I was located during the earthquake for roughly 55 hours following the event) several large landslides were triggered from all directions, the largest from perhaps 1,500 meters above just below the settlement, completely obstructing passage. The two guesthouses there were partially destroyed by large boulders, and the army checkpoint barracks collapsed during the earthquake. The night after the quake, there were two groups sleeping in separate fields by the river, keeping distance from ongoing landslides and rockfall that continued throughout the night. The first Nepal Army helicopter arrived at about 8:30am, which dropped a “medic team” and took the injured from the upper camp; the second helicopter took more from the upper camp, a chaotic mix of Nepalis and foreigners. The group from below then moved up to the Army checkpost to evacuate their injured, however, the Army helicopter never came back (we were told due to fuel shortage and/or weather – however the Army did not have a radio or phone, or any means of communicating). After these helicopters came, Nepali survivors arrived from above and below, carrying several injured – this was the group closest to the avalanche – yet, unfortunately, the Army had no way of communicating this to the rescue teams. This added a high level of uncertainty to hours of extreme grief, as Nepalis arriving from above and below realized the scale of their loss.
 
 24 hours after the slide, the Army then moved the group to a single location across the river, which proved to be the safest location. In the evening, a private helicopter (with limited seats) arrived to evacuate a group of three Nepalis, yet they were replaced with the five most injured Nepali children (thankfully, yet forcefully). After this, a few of us worked with the Nepal Army to establish a formal triage list, which was 25 Nepalis and 2 foreigners (one Dutch and one Italian) for the next large Army helicopter, which arrived the next morning.  We successfully loaded the sick onto the helicopter, with a few other family members accompanying them at roughly 10am on April 27th. The army helicopter did not come back again until 645pm, and in between a private helicopter (a single pilot who did seven trips that day singlehandedly, pro bono) took two small groups of 6 people from Ghodatabela. The loading of all these helicopters was a highly chaotic experience, owing to both fear and ineffective/confused management on behalf of the Army. Communication improved throughout, but fell apart during the most emotional moments. At Ghodatabela, there was originally roughly 65 foreigners and perhaps 110 Nepalis - as of the night of April 27th there were still about 40 foreigners and 60 Nepalis stranded there. My hope is that another helicopter has been coordinated for this morning (I will refrain from the time being from being overly critical of the helicopter evacuation system, there are pros and cons), yet I fear that many evacuation attempts were limited by the storm system that came this afternoon.
 As of April 28th, as the aftershocks/tremors and rockfall have largely subsided, I was told that a few groups have successfully traveled from Ghodatabela through Sherpagaun via the high trail to Syaphru Besi. This is good news for the remaining, yet this is highly risky.
 
 Elsewhere in Rasuwa, around Briddim and Lingling and in several places along the road from Dhunche to Betrawati, in places such as Grang and Ramche, the majority of houses collapsed. I am not sure of the casualties caused by structural collapse. The Dhunche road itself seemed passable from the air, as there are no new large slides (other than the existing monsoonal ones), but I was told by someone walking from Syaphru Besi to Kalikasthan that a member of their group had fallen to their death while travelling. Along the Trishuli River valley itself, there are other smaller landslides and reports of significant collapse at Mailung, Simle, and Archale. In Betrawati, Gerkhu, and Mhanegaun in bordering Nuwakot district several houses also collapsed, and there were casualties in all of these places.
 
 The current data on total casualties following the earthquake here in Nepal is approaching 4,500. However, this is probably an underestimate considering that the estimate for the entire district of Rasuwa is 250, and there are at least 300 dead in the area around the village of Langtang alone. Across the board, it is still very difficult to determine exactly what has occurred in remote areas off the road system, as communication is down. Considered in terms of the percentage of total population, my sense is that Rasuwa has likely the third highest rate of fatality, behind Sindhupalchowk (at the epicenter of the major aftershock) and Dhading (closer to the center of the earthquake). Again, Langtang is probably one of the greatest single tragedies of this earthquake.

Helicopters have been bringing people to Dhunche today...

In both cases, people are now walking from Dhunche south down the road (which is more stable now as the aftershocks and weather have subsided) toward Betrawati &amp;amp; Trishuli where they should be able to find some kind of ground transport to KTM.

Importantly, the fact that they are being brought to Dhunche (and not Kathmandu) is a good thing overall - because it means that helicopters can run quicker laps up into the Langtang Valley or elsewhere in Rasuwa and get more people out faster.","People Trapped, Blocked Roads, ",28.112534,85.296315,Ward,,Austin,Lord,,YES,NO,,,,,,

205,Langtang Valley - focsued on Ghodtabela,2015-04-28 23:25:00,"Ghodatabela, Langtang","Some information about the effects of the earthquake in the Langtang Valley, as well as the rest of Rasuwa:

The village of Langtang was the site of the largest single catastrophe, as the entirety of village was completely buried by an avalanche that came from thousands of feet above on the southern slopes of Langtang Lirung and Langtang II. Smaller settlements on the outskirts of Langtang, such as Chyamki, Thangsyap, and Mundu were also buried. It is impossible to determine exactly how many people died there, but the estimate is perhaps over 300 people in total. The handful of survivors, roughly twelve locals and two foreigners, walked down to Ghodatabela below after spending the night of the 25th in a cave - thus there is no one at Langtang itself. This avalanche is perhaps 2-3 kilometers wide, and is obstructing movement within the upper valley corridor. Currently two large groups are stranded above and below (due to several intensive and recurring landslides in the steep sections between Ghodatabela and Lama Hotel).
Above, at Kyangjin Gompa, there were reportedly fewer casualties (perhaps 5-10) yet many injured. Most of the injured have been evacuated via helicopter and there is an army medic team in place. Yet, currently, the problem is one of food shortage and illness. I have heard that the majority of the settlement, including the gompa, is remarkably intact. There is a smaller group of about 30-40 at the settlement of Sindum, about 4km below Kyangjin and closer to Langtang. This group has excavated several bodies from the major avalanche zone. They have also evacuated many of the injured, but are facing severe food shortages and illness (hopefully remedied by Nepal Army reinforcements and supplies on the evening of the 27th. Above Kyangjin Gompa, there were several smaller groups and climbing teams exploring the Upper Langtang valley, in a very high avalanche risk zone – I do not have good information on these groups, so please contact the respective embassies to determine who has been accounted for and evacuated via Kyangjim. As of the evening of April 27th, there was perhaps  120-140 people remaining above Langtang who need to be evacuated.
Below, at Ghodatabela (where I was located during the earthquake for roughly 55 hours following the event) several large landslides were triggered from all directions, the largest from perhaps 1,500 meters above just below the settlement, completely obstructing passage. The two guesthouses there were partially destroyed by large boulders, and the army checkpoint barracks collapsed during the earthquake. The night after the quake, there were two groups sleeping in separate fields by the river, keeping distance from ongoing landslides and rockfall that continued throughout the night. The first Nepal Army helicopter arrived at about 8:30am, which dropped a “medic team” and took the injured from the upper camp; the second helicopter took more from the upper camp, a chaotic mix of Nepalis and foreigners. The group from below then moved up to the Army checkpost to evacuate their injured, however, the Army helicopter never came back (we were told due to fuel shortage and/or weather – however the Army did not have a radio or phone, or any means of communicating). After these helicopters came, Nepali survivors arrived from above and below, carrying several injured – this was the group closest to the avalanche – yet, unfortunately, the Army had no way of communicating this to the rescue teams. This added a high level of uncertainty to hours of extreme grief, as Nepalis arriving from above and below realized the scale of their loss.
24 hours after the slide, the Army then moved the group to a single location across the river, which proved to be the safest location. In the evening, a private helicopter (with limited seats) arrived to evacuate a group of three Nepalis, yet they were replaced with the five most injured Nepali children (thankfully, yet forcefully). After this, a few of us worked with the Nepal Army to establish a formal triage list, which was 25 Nepalis and 2 foreigners (one Dutch and one Italian) for the next large Army helicopter, which arrived the next morning.  We successfully loaded the sick onto the helicopter, with a few other family members accompanying them at roughly 10am on April 27th. The army helicopter did not come back again until 645pm, and in between a private helicopter (a single pilot who did seven trips that day singlehandedly, pro bono) took two small groups of 6 people from Ghodatabela. The loading of all these helicopters was a highly chaotic experience, owing to both fear and ineffective/confused management on behalf of the Army. Communication improved throughout, but fell apart during the most emotional moments. At Ghodatabela, there was originally roughly 65 foreigners and perhaps 110 Nepalis - as of the night of April 27th there were still about 40 foreigners and 60 Nepalis stranded there. My hope is that another helicopter has been coordinated for this morning (I will refrain from the time being from being overly critical of the helicopter evacuation system, there are pros and cons), yet I fear that many evacuation attempts were limited by the storm system that came this afternoon.
As of April 28th, as the aftershocks/tremors and rockfall have largely subsided, I was told that a few groups have successfully traveled from Ghodatabela through Sherpagaun via the high trail to Syaphru Besi. This is good news for the remaining, yet this is highly risky.
Elsewhere in Rasuwa, around Briddim and Lingling and in several places along the road from Dhunche to Betrawati, in places such as Grang and Ramche, the majority of houses collapsed. I am not sure of the casualties caused by structural collapse. The Dhunche road itself seemed passable from the air, as there are no new large slides (other than the existing monsoonal ones), but I was told by someone walking from Syaphru Besi to Kalikasthan that a member of their group had fallen to their death while travelling. Along the Trishuli River valley itself, there are other smaller landslides and reports of significant collapse at Mailung, Simle, and Archale. In Betrawati, Gerkhu, and Mhanegaun in bordering Nuwakot district several houses also collapsed, and there were casualties in all of these places.
The current data on total casualties following the earthquake here in Nepal is approaching 4,500. However, this is probably an underestimate considering that the estimate for the entire district of Rasuwa is 250, and there are at least 300 dead in the area around the village of Langtang alone. Across the board, it is still very difficult to determine exactly what has occurred in remote areas off the road system, as communication is down. Considered in terms of the percentage of total population, my sense is that Rasuwa has likely the third highest rate of fatality, behind Sindhupalchowk (at the epicenter of the major aftershock) and Dhading (closer to the center of the earthquake). Again, Langtang is probably one of the greatest single tragedies of this earthquake.

This is the latest news that I have as of 5pm on April 28th","People Trapped, Blocked Roads, Shelter Area, Help Wanted, ",28.191707,85.500046,Ward,,Austin,Lord,austin.lord.yale@gmail.com,YES,NO,,,,,,

So far we have come in contact with one ward (Gumdi VDC, Ward no 6) out of the hundreds of other wards where the situation is the same. In ward no 6 which is one of the poorest, 675 people are camped in 25 camps. There are no tents, food, blanket and there is a great fear of epidemics starting from the rotting bodies. Even if we collect 1 blanket for two people we need 400 blankets, this is the situation. So please if you have the sources and are willing to help then please extend your hands.

I just had a conversation with Babita Kushwaha working with Teach for Nepal. She came back yesterday from Sindhupalchowk, one of the worst affected districts but is neglected at the moment. Babita is traumatised that the kids she taught for one year are mostly dead now. She along with her colleagues even pulled out 40 bodies themselves including one of her own colleagues.
Does anyone know any organisations that can help in Sindhupalchowk’s Nawalpur village? The focus is on the main areas of Sindhupalchowk only. No organisations/relief is reaching Nawalpur as it is really a remote place. Urgent help is required.
Almost 80-90% houses are wiped out according to locals. The focus has been on Kathmandu and city areas but we cannot forget our brothers and sisters from these remote places. I know our security personnels from Nepal are doing as much as they can but we need to hurry up. Babita can be reached at 9841140634 and babita.k36@gmail.com.
We need all the necessary items for the people who survived and rescue people who are still trapped. The roads are still inaccessible but it might get better by the time we mobilise resources for the people. Please help me spread this message widely and be able to reach the right organisation and our government to send rescue team immediately.
