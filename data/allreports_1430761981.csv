From Kimtang VDC, heavily affected VDCs of northern Dhading, Satyadevi and Darkha, are accessible on foot. The distance from Trisuli to Kimtang VDC is 35 km. (Kathmandu-Trisuli is 85 km by paved road in good condition.)

·         Dolakha: the main road via Khadichaur, Sindhupalchowk, Mude, Charikot and Mainapokhari to Jiri is open.

Bhaktapur

·         Scarcity of Drinking water is reported in the Taumadi Village and in main city areas due to damaged water supply system.

Dolakha

We were the first people there. All the people were traumatized, we witnessed multiple injuries, very poor hygiene conditions (lack of water, no spare cloting, barefoot), lack of food, water, electricity (-&amp;gt; no communication possible).

Immediate requirements:
- Recovery and sanitation of dead livestock &amp;amp; human corpses (dozens of bodies burried under debris in Asi Kilo)
- Landslides: villagers and rescue are at high risk: the ground is cracked and might just fall in at any time and/or cause landslides at the first (monsoon)rains.
- Water quality tests
- Sanitation and water
- Electricity
- Considering the water situation, a lot of people are prone to diarrea, cholera etc in the coming weeks.
- Volunteer labor and technology to rebuild the houses
- The aid we saw on the 29th was only on the main road (Turkish org distributing food + Medical assistance)
- Not much is going up, apart from some rice bags.
- Villagers told us the VDCs bought rice with the money normally allocated to build their road.

IMPORTANT: Volunteers going up there should be very fit.

Immediate needs:
- 500 tarps (one per family, and fitting 10 people)
- 5000 blankets (fleece)
- 2000 meters rope (cheap plastic thin rope + nepali jute dohai)
- 2500 slippers (adult and children)
- 1000-2000 clothes soap
- 1000-2000 dettol soap
- clean fabric for menstruation

MEDICAL DETAILS:
Most wounds were easily treatable with
- Betadine
- Gauze, cotton
- antibiotic ointment/tabs/caps
- bandages
- plaster casts
- pain medicine (tabs, syrup, topical gel)
- sterile water
- normal saline
- ORS
- sterile gloves
- tetanus toxoid
- injections
- water purification
- hand sanitizers/soap
- masks

MEDICAL REPORT:
over 100 people treated
major conditions:
- head trauma
- wound infections
- sore throats
- fever
- diarrhea
- blunt trauma with multiple small wounds
- new cuts from repairing houses
- referred emergency cases to the &quot;&quot;nearby&quot;&quot; free health care
ADVICE: follow up needed for the wound infections
Possibility of major epidemic due to lack of clean water and sanitation&quot;	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","VDC Trip Summaries, ","27.77","85.84","9803281686","","VDC","","","",YES,NO,Unactionable,NO,""

Luckily, my mother, brother, sister-in law and sister survived. 

We lost all properties of our birthplace .  I am keeping myself busy in counselling my family members……..as they cry at times…
 
The government has not been able to supply essential items to the earthquake victims to the Kavrepalanchowk district, only a few places are being covered. Dispute between the political parties have also affected to smooth supply of needy goods. 

There has been a lot of complaints from the public. I had also complained to the home ministry, district headquarters, prime Minister office…but administration is very slow...
 
As per my consultation with other village colleagues, 100 per cent houses are damaged/all are homeless. All rescue efforts are being done on the initiatives of individuals/institutions. An estimated of 311 have been declared dead in the district.
 
In my area, 5 people died due to earthquake. A total of estimated 1050 families got affected and 200 houses collapsed. Only a few number of people have been able to recover food-grains from their houses. 
 
If possible, we need to supply some very essential goods to the victims in that areas such as mattress (200), 200 sacks of rice, among others. Tents does not seem to be a problem now as these items are being supplied by individuals/institutions as well. We have to make a team in the areas with local participation and handover.

"1153","Sindhupalchok - District Wide Assessment","2015-05-02 14:19:00","Sindhupalchok, Bagmati, Central Region, Nepal","In the wake of the recent earthquake in Nepal and its severe impact in Sindhupalchowk, there have been a number of NGOs, informal organisations, individuals and the Nepalese government working to provide basic relief aid to a number of VDCs. However, as these efforts have not been coordinated and as no supply chain has been established as of yet, our efforts have not been effective and aid has not been distributed in an equitable manner. Many villages, where there is no road access, for instance have not received any support and this is causing local anger, tension and is hampering the aid delivery and distribution process. 
In order to address this and to support the work undertaken by the many organisations and individuals, Clean up Nepal is undertaking a district-wide survey of the open shelters and number of people at each shelter in order to create a database that will assist organisations to contribute to needs more effectively.

We are seeking 200 proactive, independent and self-motivated individuals to collect this data at different VDCs of Sindhupalchowk tomorrow on the 3rd of May 2015. As many of these VDCs are not accessible by bus, we will require at least 100 individuals to have their own mode of transport, i.e. bikes. Data collection will take place in pairs and each pair will be required to collect data from one VDC. There are 79 VDCs in Sindhupalchowk. Most VDCs are accessible by bike.

An orientation will be held at the Clean up Nepal office in Minbhawan tomorrow on 03 May 2015 at 8am. The location map for the Clean up Nepal office can be found at: http://cleanupnepal.org.np/contact-us/. For more information, please contact Neelam Pradhananga on neelam_pradhananga@yahoo.com and Yam Karki on 9851 172 357. For URGENT inquiries only, please sms Neelam on 9808 211 827 with your inquiry and she will get back to you. 

If you are interested in volunteering, please fill out this form and come to the  Clean up Nepal office at 8am sharp tomorrow (03 May 2015).

There was a district-level committee meeting yesterday in Simikot, where representatives from all areas of Humla were in attendance. The official word is that no casualties resulted in Humla District as a results of the earthquake, and as far as everyone can tell, there has been no structural damage. Rockfall and landslides, however, do continue to persist, especially in Upper Humla (in the area between Simikot and the China/Tibet border). This winter was very harsh in Humla - snow continues to fall in the villages above 12,000ft. Since the earthquake, everyone here has been on high alert, and travel between villages is being kept to bare necessity. Although people here in Simikot are thankful that there was no earthquake damage in Humla, prayers and thoughts continue to all of those that were not so lucky.","Other Damage, Other, ","29.994002","81.840553","","","Ward","Michelle","Grocke","m.grocke@gmail.com",YES,NO,Unactionable,NO,""

People remain at other places in Rasuwa, such as Dhunche, Syaphru Besi, and Thuman VDC. Most roads in the area are not motorable or passable, but several individuals have reported that the main road south from Dhunche is passable on foot (obstructed by rockfall, but with no new large landslides - amazingly). Evacuation efforts can thus be conducted from the Kalikasthan/Ramche area, above Betrawati via vehicle - the road is reported clear from Betrawati to Kathmandu.

Devastation of local villages and agricultural lands in the district of Rasuwa remain severe. And casualties in the Langtang valley are estimated near 300.

Distance : 70 Km from Kathmandu whereas 7 Km from Melemchi Town
Number of Household : 75
Population : 500 (approx.)
Number of house destructed : Almost 100% household destructed
Number of Death : 8
Number of Causality : 15 to 20
Drinking Water : Spring Water (All water reserve destroyed, currently all villagers 
are relying on open source water without treatment or purification)
Sanitation : Entire toilet destroyed, currently all are using open toilet.
Type of House Make : Most of houses are made off of Mud and stone
Food Stock : Nil
Medication : 
• One health post exist but not operational since 14th of Baishak
• Currently villagers don’t have severe illness except minor fever and common cold.
• No diarrhea at present but due to carcass stuck on ravages of remains is expected to start contagious diseases. ( Degree: Critical)
• No access to even basic medicine facility.
As per our interview with local authority Mr Kamal Karki, there are 15 wards in Melamchi Muncipality. Approximately 15-20 thousand population with more than 6000 households. So far 812 people accounted dead and number of causalities are unaccounted. Major source of water is spring water, and no provision for water purification availed so far.

This is from a FB post (sad sad one) of Sashank of a remote village in Sindhupalchowk district of Nepal.

My home is Sindhupalchowk, and I am from remote VDC Selang-9. My home and my village is completely destroyed. I have walked three hours this evening down to nearby Jalbire town. I had come to this nearby town hoping to meet some relief workers, but until now I am yet to meet anyone. I could access Facebook in Jalbire. I could not access the NTC and NCELL network. Sky (network) used to exist, but has ceased to work after earthquake.

Not a bit of chau-chau (ramen noodles) and biscuit has reached my village yet. I learned from Facebook that most think of Sankhu, Melamchi, Chautara and Barabise when they think of Sindhupalchowk. Sindhupalchowk is very remote, with 70-80 village development committees. This earthquake has destroyed the whole of Sindhupalchowk. 99% of it. Among my relatives in my village, 15 have died. This death may not even be counted or acted upon. If the rescue team goes to all villages and counts the death tool, there will most likely be 5-6 thousands in Sindhupalchowk alone. So many more are still unknown. Rescue teams have reached neither in our village, nor other 100-200 villages. We dug out many dead bodies through mutual help. Still many remain. Lots of animals have died, and it is beginning to stink. To reach my home, you have to walk further 25 kilometers from the Arniko highway. I know that there are many other villages that can be reached by over one day’s trek from my village. If nothing has reached my village, you can imagine if anything has reached in other villages.

I do not know why I am posting all this. There is a healthpost near my village. I know that people from villages located one days’ walk from my village come to this health post to get cetamol (popular painkiller in Nepal). I am not expecting that the villages that have not yet seen cetamol during all these years will see rescue teams.

Still I will be grateful if someone reads this post and tells the concerned agencies that Sindhupalchowk is big and remote. I will be truly grateful if someone takes initiative to ensure that supports are not limited to Sankhu and Melamchi, but all 70 VDCs including to our village.

Hello again Bijaya:

I am writing these notes you requested on behalf of Mr. Lotte Lama - a former resident of Upper Tsum Valley in the village of Chhokang Paro.  He asked me to send you his report.  These notes are in hopes of your facilitation of much needed food to the three areas of Tsum.  Nubri, Lower and Upper Tsum.  Lotte has heard from his sister who is a nun at Rachen Gompa near Burji.  The Gompa is easy to see from the air.  It has a red plaster and stone fence around the property.

1.  Barpak is approximately 30-40 miles from Chhokang Paro in Upper Tsum.  The trail to Tsum goes up the Budhi Gandaki and most likely completely unusable because of landslides. There are no roads into any part of Tsum. Helicopter is only way in now. 

2.  There are approximately 10-11,000 people in all of Tsum Valley.

3.  The people are in desperate need of food.  Rice, wheat, noodles, cooking oil and vegetables are important.

There were water taps in the villages and we don't know if they are still working.  There is a river through the main valley for Upper and Lower Tsum for water supplies.

4. They request warm clothes for babies, kids and adults.  The Upper Tsum sits at about 10,000 ft (over 3,000 meters).  It is very cold there right now.

5.  Chhokang Paro seems to be the hardest hit by the quake.  We know the village of Chhokang Paro is completely leveled. No structures exist now.  Unfortunately the grain and food for humans and livestock in mixed into the mess of rocks, timbers and water - and completely lost.  This is a huge humanitarian crisis as there is no way to resupply these residents by land. 
It is reported there is less structural damage as one goes up the valley toward Mu Gompa.

6.  In Lower Tsum - Ripchet had a substantial fire in the village.  There might be injuries there.  We don't know. We have not heard from Chumling. The trail is blocked. There is no electricity or communication in the valley.

7.  Nubri is to the west of these areas of Tsum and we don't know what has happened there.  Tsum residents have not been able to communicate with them. But it is similar to Lower and Upper Tsum - and very hard to travel there. There is a major monastery at Surang Gompa nearish to Nubri.  We don't know how they fared in the quake.

8.  In Upper Tsum there are plenty of open fields to land an helicopter...near Chhokang Paro.  There are fields to the immediate south of Ripchet in which to land.  There is a new trekkers' lodge at Burji and a field just to the immediate north for landing.  If the copter goes over a Mr. Dhawa Lama will probably come out to direct the copter to a landing spot.  There is a grassy field behind his lodge.  He is there now with some French trekkers.

9.  There is a nun at Domje in Lower Tsum who is trained as a dentist and doctor. She might be a big help if she can be contacted and given medical supplies.","Blocked Roads, Medical Assiatance, Food/Water/Shelter, ","28.505161","85.073058","+1-703-864-3622","","Region","Ron","Ranson","rranson@ucsd.edu",YES,NO,Actionable+Urgent,NO,""

This info comes from talking to Meena (9841733666) who is co-ordinating local relief efforts. You can also contact Samrat Shrestha (9851082918) who can assist.
If you wish to talk to me, my number is 9818673545, 

In Bungamati there are 1200 families (4000-6000 people)displaced.

NEEDS: sufficient shelter for them to be comfortable whilst they rebuild their homes. At present there are some tents and plastic sheeting, but conditions are cramped. More shelter needed.

TOILETS: Displaced people do not have access to toilets and are defecating in the open, presenting serious health risks. LATRINES ARE A PRIORITY.

WATER: There is water in the communal tanks which is being refilled by tanker, however it is being used faster than it is being replenished.

RUBBLE CLEARING: There is significant damage to many buildings in Bungamati,and people lack tools and equipment to clear the rubble. 

They report they are ok for food and medicine at present, but could do with more clothes (especially children).

They also report that most of contributions have come from individual donations, rather than government or aid support. 

It is thought there is no one trapped in the rubble, but this is unconfirmed.

The road going into Bungamati from KTM is fine.","Shelter Area, Help Wanted, ","27.627597","85.303723","","","Ward","Kyle","Mohamed","kylemo37@gmail.com",YES,NO,Actionable,NO,""

I just had a conversation with Pratima Gole working as a primary teacher in the local School and also hail from the place Manikhel, one of the worst affected hilly VDCs but is neglected at the moment. She is traumatised that the people are starving and have no place to sleep and no clothes to wear. They are sheltering in the ground of a local school without any support for their lives.
Almost 80-90% houses are wiped out according her,5 people were killed and around 70 are injured by the devastation. The focus has been on Kathmandu and city areas but we cannot forget our brothers and sisters from these remote places. I know our security personnel from Nepal are doing as much as they can but we need to hurry up. We need all the necessary items for the people who survived and rescue people who are still trapped. The roads are still inaccessible but it might get better by the time we mobilise resources for the people.  
The village is situated 50 KM far from the Capital city in the south and in geographically hilly region. The link here directs the place where we would like to support the people.

As a result of earthquake on April 25th, 2015, many villagers in the above areas lost their homes and are homeless.  They have been spending nights outdoor under poor weather condition and without proper shelters (lack of tents and necessary items to keep warm).

Although the main building of the clinic was destroyed, we believe that another section, containing medical supplies and some shelter is still intact. More importantly, the clinic is staffed by a physicians assistant and former army medic, who have escaped injury and are helping local residents. There is also an open level area (unusual for this area) that we believe is suitable as a helicopter landing zone.

Approximately 7,000 people, many elderly and children live in the Baseri region and it is the northern most settlement in that section of Nepal, approximately 25 miles from the epicenter.

"272","Carnage at Langtang","2015-04-29 10:53:00","Langtang, Rasuwa, Bagmati, Central Development Region, Nepal","Some information about the effects of the earthquake in the Langtang Valley, as well as the rest of Rasuwa:
 
 The village of Langtang was the site of the largest single catastrophe, as the entirety of village was completely buried by an avalanche that came from thousands of feet above on the southern slopes of Langtang Lirung and Langtang II. Smaller settlements on the outskirts of Langtang, such as Chyamki, Thangsyap, and Mundu were also buried. It is impossible to determine exactly how many people died there, but the estimate is perhaps over 300 people in total. The handful of survivors, roughly twelve locals and two foreigners, walked down to Ghodatabela below after spending the night of the 25th in a cave - thus there is no one at Langtang itself. This avalanche is perhaps 2-3 kilometers wide, and is obstructing movement within the upper valley corridor. Currently two large groups are stranded above and below (due to several intensive and recurring landslides in the steep sections between Ghodatabela and Lama Hotel).
 
 Above, at Kyangjin Gompa, there were reportedly fewer casualties (perhaps 5-10) yet many injured. Most of the injured have been evacuated via helicopter and there is an army medic team in place. Yet, currently, the problem is one of food shortage and illness. I have heard that the majority of the settlement, including the gompa, is remarkably intact. There is a smaller group of about 30-40 at the settlement of Sindum, about 4km below Kyangjin and closer to Langtang. This group has excavated several bodies from the major avalanche zone. They have also evacuated many of the injured, but are facing severe food shortages and illness (hopefully remedied by Nepal Army reinforcements and supplies on the evening of the 27th. Above Kyangjin Gompa, there were several smaller groups and climbing teams exploring the Upper Langtang valley, in a very high avalanche risk zone – I do not have good information on these groups, so please contact the respective embassies to determine who has been accounted for and evacuated via Kyangjim. As of the evening of April 27th, there was perhaps  120-140 people remaining above Langtang who need to be evacuated.
 
 Below, at Ghodatabela (where I was located during the earthquake for roughly 55 hours following the event) several large landslides were triggered from all directions, the largest from perhaps 1,500 meters above just below the settlement, completely obstructing passage. The two guesthouses there were partially destroyed by large boulders, and the army checkpoint barracks collapsed during the earthquake. The night after the quake, there were two groups sleeping in separate fields by the river, keeping distance from ongoing landslides and rockfall that continued throughout the night. The first Nepal Army helicopter arrived at about 8:30am, which dropped a “medic team” and took the injured from the upper camp; the second helicopter took more from the upper camp, a chaotic mix of Nepalis and foreigners. The group from below then moved up to the Army checkpost to evacuate their injured, however, the Army helicopter never came back (we were told due to fuel shortage and/or weather – however the Army did not have a radio or phone, or any means of communicating). After these helicopters came, Nepali survivors arrived from above and below, carrying several injured – this was the group closest to the avalanche – yet, unfortunately, the Army had no way of communicating this to the rescue teams. This added a high level of uncertainty to hours of extreme grief, as Nepalis arriving from above and below realized the scale of their loss.
 
 24 hours after the slide, the Army then moved the group to a single location across the river, which proved to be the safest location. In the evening, a private helicopter (with limited seats) arrived to evacuate a group of three Nepalis, yet they were replaced with the five most injured Nepali children (thankfully, yet forcefully). After this, a few of us worked with the Nepal Army to establish a formal triage list, which was 25 Nepalis and 2 foreigners (one Dutch and one Italian) for the next large Army helicopter, which arrived the next morning.  We successfully loaded the sick onto the helicopter, with a few other family members accompanying them at roughly 10am on April 27th. The army helicopter did not come back again until 645pm, and in between a private helicopter (a single pilot who did seven trips that day singlehandedly, pro bono) took two small groups of 6 people from Ghodatabela. The loading of all these helicopters was a highly chaotic experience, owing to both fear and ineffective/confused management on behalf of the Army. Communication improved throughout, but fell apart during the most emotional moments. At Ghodatabela, there was originally roughly 65 foreigners and perhaps 110 Nepalis - as of the night of April 27th there were still about 40 foreigners and 60 Nepalis stranded there. My hope is that another helicopter has been coordinated for this morning (I will refrain from the time being from being overly critical of the helicopter evacuation system, there are pros and cons), yet I fear that many evacuation attempts were limited by the storm system that came this afternoon.
 As of April 28th, as the aftershocks/tremors and rockfall have largely subsided, I was told that a few groups have successfully traveled from Ghodatabela through Sherpagaun via the high trail to Syaphru Besi. This is good news for the remaining, yet this is highly risky.
 
 Elsewhere in Rasuwa, around Briddim and Lingling and in several places along the road from Dhunche to Betrawati, in places such as Grang and Ramche, the majority of houses collapsed. I am not sure of the casualties caused by structural collapse. The Dhunche road itself seemed passable from the air, as there are no new large slides (other than the existing monsoonal ones), but I was told by someone walking from Syaphru Besi to Kalikasthan that a member of their group had fallen to their death while travelling. Along the Trishuli River valley itself, there are other smaller landslides and reports of significant collapse at Mailung, Simle, and Archale. In Betrawati, Gerkhu, and Mhanegaun in bordering Nuwakot district several houses also collapsed, and there were casualties in all of these places.
 
 The current data on total casualties following the earthquake here in Nepal is approaching 4,500. However, this is probably an underestimate considering that the estimate for the entire district of Rasuwa is 250, and there are at least 300 dead in the area around the village of Langtang alone. Across the board, it is still very difficult to determine exactly what has occurred in remote areas off the road system, as communication is down. Considered in terms of the percentage of total population, my sense is that Rasuwa has likely the third highest rate of fatality, behind Sindhupalchowk (at the epicenter of the major aftershock) and Dhading (closer to the center of the earthquake). Again, Langtang is probably one of the greatest single tragedies of this earthquake.

This group likely includes large groups of citizens from Estonia and Germany, as per this list.

Helicopters have been bringing people to Dhunche today... I heard that at least one helicopter load (not sure of size) was evacuated this morning, and someone else also told me that a helicopter came to Syaphru Besi this morning. In both cases, people are now walking from Dhunche south down the road (which is more stable now as the aftershocks and weather have subsided) toward Betrawati &amp;amp; Trishuli where they should be able to find some kind of ground transport to KTM.

Importantly, the fact that they are being brought to Dhunche (and not Kathmandu) is a good thing overall - because it means that helicopters can run quicker laps up into the Langtang Valley or elsewhere in Rasuwa and get more people out faster.","People Trapped, Blocked Roads, ","28.112534","85.296315","","","Ward","Austin","Lord","",YES,NO,Actionable,NO,""

"205","Langtang Valley - focsued on Ghodtabela","2015-04-28 23:25:00","Ghodatabela, Langtang","Some information about the effects of the earthquake in the Langtang Valley, as well as the rest of Rasuwa:

The village of Langtang was the site of the largest single catastrophe, as the entirety of village was completely buried by an avalanche that came from thousands of feet above on the southern slopes of Langtang Lirung and Langtang II. Smaller settlements on the outskirts of Langtang, such as Chyamki, Thangsyap, and Mundu were also buried. It is impossible to determine exactly how many people died there, but the estimate is perhaps over 300 people in total. The handful of survivors, roughly twelve locals and two foreigners, walked down to Ghodatabela below after spending the night of the 25th in a cave - thus there is no one at Langtang itself. This avalanche is perhaps 2-3 kilometers wide, and is obstructing movement within the upper valley corridor. Currently two large groups are stranded above and below (due to several intensive and recurring landslides in the steep sections between Ghodatabela and Lama Hotel).
Above, at Kyangjin Gompa, there were reportedly fewer casualties (perhaps 5-10) yet many injured. Most of the injured have been evacuated via helicopter and there is an army medic team in place. Yet, currently, the problem is one of food shortage and illness. I have heard that the majority of the settlement, including the gompa, is remarkably intact. There is a smaller group of about 30-40 at the settlement of Sindum, about 4km below Kyangjin and closer to Langtang. This group has excavated several bodies from the major avalanche zone. They have also evacuated many of the injured, but are facing severe food shortages and illness (hopefully remedied by Nepal Army reinforcements and supplies on the evening of the 27th. Above Kyangjin Gompa, there were several smaller groups and climbing teams exploring the Upper Langtang valley, in a very high avalanche risk zone – I do not have good information on these groups, so please contact the respective embassies to determine who has been accounted for and evacuated via Kyangjim. As of the evening of April 27th, there was perhaps  120-140 people remaining above Langtang who need to be evacuated.
Below, at Ghodatabela (where I was located during the earthquake for roughly 55 hours following the event) several large landslides were triggered from all directions, the largest from perhaps 1,500 meters above just below the settlement, completely obstructing passage. The two guesthouses there were partially destroyed by large boulders, and the army checkpoint barracks collapsed during the earthquake. The night after the quake, there were two groups sleeping in separate fields by the river, keeping distance from ongoing landslides and rockfall that continued throughout the night. The first Nepal Army helicopter arrived at about 8:30am, which dropped a “medic team” and took the injured from the upper camp; the second helicopter took more from the upper camp, a chaotic mix of Nepalis and foreigners. The group from below then moved up to the Army checkpost to evacuate their injured, however, the Army helicopter never came back (we were told due to fuel shortage and/or weather – however the Army did not have a radio or phone, or any means of communicating). After these helicopters came, Nepali survivors arrived from above and below, carrying several injured – this was the group closest to the avalanche – yet, unfortunately, the Army had no way of communicating this to the rescue teams. This added a high level of uncertainty to hours of extreme grief, as Nepalis arriving from above and below realized the scale of their loss.
24 hours after the slide, the Army then moved the group to a single location across the river, which proved to be the safest location. In the evening, a private helicopter (with limited seats) arrived to evacuate a group of three Nepalis, yet they were replaced with the five most injured Nepali children (thankfully, yet forcefully). After this, a few of us worked with the Nepal Army to establish a formal triage list, which was 25 Nepalis and 2 foreigners (one Dutch and one Italian) for the next large Army helicopter, which arrived the next morning.  We successfully loaded the sick onto the helicopter, with a few other family members accompanying them at roughly 10am on April 27th. The army helicopter did not come back again until 645pm, and in between a private helicopter (a single pilot who did seven trips that day singlehandedly, pro bono) took two small groups of 6 people from Ghodatabela. The loading of all these helicopters was a highly chaotic experience, owing to both fear and ineffective/confused management on behalf of the Army. Communication improved throughout, but fell apart during the most emotional moments. At Ghodatabela, there was originally roughly 65 foreigners and perhaps 110 Nepalis - as of the night of April 27th there were still about 40 foreigners and 60 Nepalis stranded there. My hope is that another helicopter has been coordinated for this morning (I will refrain from the time being from being overly critical of the helicopter evacuation system, there are pros and cons), yet I fear that many evacuation attempts were limited by the storm system that came this afternoon.
As of April 28th, as the aftershocks/tremors and rockfall have largely subsided, I was told that a few groups have successfully traveled from Ghodatabela through Sherpagaun via the high trail to Syaphru Besi. This is good news for the remaining, yet this is highly risky.
Elsewhere in Rasuwa, around Briddim and Lingling and in several places along the road from Dhunche to Betrawati, in places such as Grang and Ramche, the majority of houses collapsed. I am not sure of the casualties caused by structural collapse. The Dhunche road itself seemed passable from the air, as there are no new large slides (other than the existing monsoonal ones), but I was told by someone walking from Syaphru Besi to Kalikasthan that a member of their group had fallen to their death while travelling. Along the Trishuli River valley itself, there are other smaller landslides and reports of significant collapse at Mailung, Simle, and Archale. In Betrawati, Gerkhu, and Mhanegaun in bordering Nuwakot district several houses also collapsed, and there were casualties in all of these places.
The current data on total casualties following the earthquake here in Nepal is approaching 4,500. However, this is probably an underestimate considering that the estimate for the entire district of Rasuwa is 250, and there are at least 300 dead in the area around the village of Langtang alone. Across the board, it is still very difficult to determine exactly what has occurred in remote areas off the road system, as communication is down. Considered in terms of the percentage of total population, my sense is that Rasuwa has likely the third highest rate of fatality, behind Sindhupalchowk (at the epicenter of the major aftershock) and Dhading (closer to the center of the earthquake). Again, Langtang is probably one of the greatest single tragedies of this earthquake.

"941","Help Need in Nawalpur Sindhupalchowk","2015-04-28 14:45:00","Nawalpur, Bagmati, Central Region, Nepal","This is an urgent appeal. I just had a conversation with Babita Kushwaha working with Teach for Nepal. She came back yesterday from Sindhupalchowk, one of the worst affected districts but is neglected at the moment. Babita is traumatised that the kids she taught for one year are mostly dead now. She along with her colleagues even pulled out 40 bodies themselves including one of her own colleagues.
Does anyone know any organisations that can help in Sindhupalchowk’s Nawalpur village? The focus is on the main areas of Sindhupalchowk only. No organisations/relief is reaching Nawalpur as it is really a remote place. Urgent help is required.
Almost 80-90% houses are wiped out according to locals. The focus has been on Kathmandu and city areas but we cannot forget our brothers and sisters from these remote places. I know our security personnels from Nepal are doing as much as they can but we need to hurry up. Babita can be reached at 9841140634 and babita.k36@gmail.com.
We need all the necessary items for the people who survived and rescue people who are still trapped. The roads are still inaccessible but it might get better by the time we mobilise resources for the people. Please help me spread this message widely and be able to reach the right organisation and our government to send rescue team immediately.

This is a huge humanitarian crisis as there is no way to resupply these residents by land. In Upper Tsum there are plenty of open fields to land an helicopter...near Chhokang Paro.  There are fields to the immediate south of Ripchet in which to land.  Ripchet is one of the poorest places I have ever seen (Ron writing).   There is a new trekkers' lodge at Burji and a field just to the immediate north for landing.  If the copter goes over a Mr. Dhawa Lama will probably come out to direct the copter to a landing spot.  There is a grassy field behind his lodge.  He is there now with some French trekkers.
