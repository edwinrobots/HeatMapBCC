For use with a simulation that generates random new tweets.

tweet_templates.txt  -- templates for generating simulated tweets

--- Ushahidi ---

Probably best to use this:

exported_ushahidi.csv -- ID,CATEGORY,DATE,TIME,LAT,LON,TITLE,VERIFIED. 3604 records.

All files have 3603 records. Older/other files are:

exported_ushahidi_titles.ods -- Full details of the messages. ID, Category, Date, Time, Lat, Lon, Title, Verified.
ushahidi_titles.csv -- Titles of the messsages + shows whether they are verified or not. This is not complete information.
exported_ushahidi_data.csv -- ID, APPROVED, CATEGORY, DATE, TIME, LAT, LON, TITLE, VERIFIED, LOCATION. 
The extra "approved" category is yes for all but a handful of messages.

--- Output Files ---

output.txt -- outputs a JSON file with combined reports. Each combined report is a peak on the heatmap.
